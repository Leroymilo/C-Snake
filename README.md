# Cpp-Snake
A game of snake I codded in C++ for fun

Download the Snake.exe file for a qwerty (wasd keys) keyboard and SnakeFR.exe for an azerty (zqsd keys) keyboard.
So wasd (or zqsd) keys to move, x to quit.

You can change the size of the board in hte Snake.cpp file at lines 8 & 9,
and the input keys can also be changed at lines 50, 54, 58 and 62,
but you'll need to recompile the file or just ask me to compile it for you.
